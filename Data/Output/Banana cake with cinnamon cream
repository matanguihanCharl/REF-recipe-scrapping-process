Methods
Step 1 
Preheat oven to 180C. Grease and line the base 
and side of a 20cm round cake pan. 
Step 2 
Combine the flour, baking powder, caster sugar, 
nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a large 
bowl. Whisk banana, oil, egg and vanilla in a 
medium bowl. Pour the egg mixture into the flour 
mixture and stir until just combined. Pour into 
prepared pan and level top. Bake for 55 mins or 
until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out 
clean. Cool in pan for 5 mins. Turn out onto a wire 
rack to cool completely. 
Step 3 
Using an electric beater, beat cream, icing sugar 
and remaining cinnamon in a bowl until soft peaks 
form. 
Step 4 
Spilt cake in half horizontally. Place half the cream 
on the cake base. Top with remaining cake. Spread 
remaining cream over the top. Decorate with extra 
banana and drizzle with golden syrup.
